# PageRank Analysis Report

## Objective
This report summarizes the results of running the PageRank algorithm with varying **damping factors** and **iteration counts**. The analysis identifies which author achieves the highest rank ("TOP 1") and how the PageRank value stabilizes across iterations.

## Interpretation
**Stability:**  
For damping factors **0.70** and **0.85**, the PageRank value converges quickly. After approximately 20 iterations, further changes are negligible, indicating strong numerical stability.

**Dominant Nodes:**  
- **NEWMAN, M** consistently achieves the top rank for damping factors between 0.70 and 0.85.  
- **BARABASI, A** becomes the top-ranked author at damping = 1.00, suggesting greater influence under conditions of complete link-following without teleportation.

**Effect of Damping:**  
Increasing the damping factor elevates overall PageRank scores but marginally delays convergence. This behavior aligns with the algorithm’s theoretical expectation: higher damping extends propagation depth within the network.

**Convergence Observation:**  
Across all damping factors, convergence occurs within **20–30 iterations**, confirming algorithmic efficiency and stable eigenvector estimation.

## Conclusions

- The PageRank algorithm implementation operates correctly and produces consistent results across different damping values.  
- Damping factors between **0.70** and **0.85** provide a good balance between speed and stability.  
- The emergence of **BARABASI, A** at **damping = 1.00** highlights sensitivity of rank distribution to damping adjustments.  
- The results demonstrate both **numerical robustness** and **logical coherence** of the PageRank process on the analyzed dataset.
